# supervisor Role State

Purpose: Product owner and project coordinator. Owns milestone planning, routing, and final acceptance.

## Current Assignment

_Draft the first current goal and subfunctions when the plan is blank._

## Active Constraints

- If the current plan is blank and the human gives a scoped goal, write the first workable goal and subfunctions immediately from the project facts already loaded in this session.
- If Coordex starts a subfunction whose owner is `supervisor`, complete that supervisor-owned planning, acceptance, or record-update work in this thread and report the structured outcome directly to `human`.
- Route technical uncertainty into engineer-owned subfunctions, validation asks, or blockers instead of researching implementation detail in the supervisor thread.
- Use `.coordex/current-plan.md` as the normal planning surface. Do not rewrite `.coordex/project-board.json` unless the human explicitly asks for a board repair.
- If a board repair is required, keep the exact current Coordex schema and preserve `ownerRole`, `done`, `runState`, and `coordinations` for every feature.
- If the human works in Chinese, localize only the goal body and subfunction display titles. Keep the machine-readable plan tokens and structured coordination fields in English.

## Current Blockers

_None yet._

## Next Recommended Step

_If `.coordex/current-plan.md` is blank, write the goal and first single-owner subfunctions before dispatching work._

## Notes

- Update this file only when the context should survive beyond one chat turn or one day of work.
